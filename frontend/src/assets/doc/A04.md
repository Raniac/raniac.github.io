## What is Microservice?

> [**Microservices**](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)  
> By [*Martin Fowler*](https://martinfowler.com/)  
> The term "Microservice Architecture" has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services. While there is no precise definition of this architectural style, there are certain common characteristics around organization around business capability, automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data.
> The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

### Principles of Microservice Design

- Self-Administration
- Stateless Services
- Communication with APIs
- Forward/Backward Compatibility
- Hierarchical/Acyclic Dependency

## What is DevOps?

DevOps facilitates collaboration between development and operations. With the implementation of batched delivery, incremental release, frequent deployment, and fast feedback, DevOps improves the reliability, stability, scalability, and security of software deployed and running in the production environment.

### Agile Development

- ```Iteration -> Design -> Develop -> Test -> Verify -> Release -> Review -> Next Iteration```;
- Building is always triggered by a commit&push;
- There is always a built package/image ready for execution/deployment.

### CI/CD

- Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment.

### Introduction to NEURO-LEARN

[NEURO-LEARN](https://github.com/Raniac/NEURO-LEARN/) is a solution for collaborative pattern analysis of neuroimaging data. Its collaboration scheme consists of four parts: projects, data, analysis, and reports. While data preparation workflows defined in projects reduce the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data by collaborative computation, pooling of derived data and sharing of pattern analysis workflows along with generated reports on the Web enlarge the sample size and ensure the reliability and reproducibility of pattern analysis. Incorporating this scheme, NEURO-LEARN provides an easy-to-use Web application that allows users from different sites to share projects and processed data, perform pattern analysis, and obtain result reports.

### NLD as Microservices

- ```raniac/neuro-learn-website:dev```
- ```raniac/neuro-learn-service:commons```
- ```raniac/neuro-learn-service:ml```
- ```raniac/neuro-learn-service:sgn```

### NLD with DevOps

- Standardized Runtime Container
- Standardized Development Process
- Standardized Image Building
- Decoupling and Incrementality

#### Version Control

##### Git

- Repository: [```GitHub/NEURO-LEARN-DOCKER```](https://github.com/Raniac/NEURO-LEARN-DOCKER)
- Branches: ```master```, ```dev```, etc.;
- Collaboration: pull/merge requests.

#### Continuous Integration

##### Automated Build

![Docker](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/13702947-da1f10aafa91b713.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

```bash
## !!!! BUILD IMAGES !!!!

# docker build -t raniac/neuro-learn-env:commons ../envs/commons/;
# docker build -t raniac/neuro-learn-env:ml ../envs/ml/;
# docker build -t raniac/neuro-learn-env:sgn ../envs/sgn/;

# docker build -t raniac/neuro-learn-website:dev ../website/;
# docker build -t raniac/neuro-learn-service:commons ../services/commons/;
# docker build -t raniac/neuro-learn-service:ml ../services/ml/;
# docker build -t raniac/neuro-learn-service:sgn ../services/sgn/;

## !!!! PUSH IMAGES !!!!

# docker push raniac/neuro-learn-website:dev;
# docker push raniac/neuro-learn-service:commons;
# docker push raniac/neuro-learn-service:ml;
# docker push raniac/neuro-learn-service:sgn;

# docker push raniac/neuro-learn-env:commons;
# docker push raniac/neuro-learn-env:ml;
# docker push raniac/neuro-learn-env:sgn;

## !!!! INITIATE CONTAINERS FOR DEV !!!!

# docker run -it --rm --network host -v /home/raniac/dev/NEURO-LEARN-DOCKER/services/commons:/nls-commons neuro-learn-service:commons /bin/bash
# docker run -it --rm --network host -v /home/raniac/dev/NEURO-LEARN-DOCKER/services/ml:/nls-ml neuro-learn-service:ml /bin/bash
# docker run -it --rm --network host -v /home/raniac/dev/NEURO-LEARN-DOCKER/services/sgn:/nls-sgn neuro-learn-service:sgn /bin/bash
```

##### Automated Tests

- Unit Tests
- Functional Tests
- Integrated Verification

##### Automated Deployment

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

```yml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '2'

services:
  website:
    image: raniac/neuro-learn-website:dev
    # restart: on-failure
    network_mode: host
    container_name: website-dev

  service-commons:
    image: raniac/neuro-learn-service:commons
    # restart: on-failure
    network_mode: host
    container_name: service-commons

  service-ml:
    image: raniac/neuro-learn-service:ml
    # restart: on-failure
    network_mode: host
    container_name: service-ml

  service-sgn:
    image: raniac/neuro-learn-service:sgn
    # restart: on-failure
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - /home/raniac/dev/NEURO-LEARN-DOCKER/services/sgn/models:/nld_sgn/models
    container_name: service-sgn
```

#### Operations

- ```healthcheck```
  - Add healthcheck api for heartbeat detection and hence service registration/discovery;
  - Also used for unit test.
- ```logs```
  - Run docker container with parameter: ```-v /opt/apps/{serviceName}/logs:/{serviceRoot}/logs``` or configure it in ```docker-compose.yml```.
