- #### Count of files and directories
```bash
ls -l | grep "^-" | wc -l # count of regular files in current directory
ls -lR | grep "^-" | wc -l # count of regular files in current dir including those in sub-folders
```
```bash
ls -l | grep "^d" | wc -l # count of directories in current directory
ls -lR | grep "^d" | wc -l # count of directories in current directory including those in sub-folders
```
```bash
# Explaination
ls -l # means outputing the information of the specified directory as a list
# -R means recursively, showing the files within directories
| # means using the output of the command before it as the input of the one behind it
grep # means Globally search a Regular Expression and Print
# and "^d" represents directories, "^-" files
wc -l # means counting the number of lines of the output
# which in this case equals to the number of files/directories
```

- #### View files: cat, more and less
Basically *cat* can print the whole file in the terminal, which is convenient when file size is relatively small. But when file size is large and pagination is needed, *more* and *less* are both competent. A very useful argument that shows the line number is *-n* (for *cat*) and *-N* (for *less*).
> cat是一次性显示整个文件的内容，还可以将多个文件连接起来显示，它常与重定向符号配合使用，适用于文件内容少的情况；more和less一般用于显示文件内容超过一屏的内容，并且提供翻页的功能。more比cat强大，提供分页显示的功能，less比more更强大，提供翻页，跳转，查找等命令；而且more和less都支持：用空格显示下一页，按键b显示上一页。下面详细介绍这3个命令。

- #### Use of scp
```bash
# copy local file to remote folder with username designated
# password for the username will then be required
scp local_file remote_username@remote_ip:remote_folder 
# copy local file to remote folder with designated filename
scp local_file remote_username@remote_ip:remote_file 
# copy local file to remote folder without username designated
# username and password will then be required
scp local_file remote_ip:remote_folder 
# copy local file to remote folder with designated filename
scp local_file remote_ip:remote_file 
```
```bash
# copy local folder to remote folder
# attention: the copied folder will be under the remote folder
scp -r local_folder remote_username@remote_ip:remote_folder 
# without username designated
scp -r local_folder remote_ip:remote_folder 
```
```bash
# copy remote file or folder to local
scp root@www.runoob.com:/home/root/others/music /home/space/music/1.mp3 
scp -r www.runoob.com:/home/root/others/ /home/space/music/
```

- #### What's in /etc?
```bash
/etc/profile # contains the environment variables for all users
~/.bashrc # contains the environment variables for current user
```
> *Reference:* [Linux /etc/profile文件详解](https://www.cnblogs.com/alliance/p/7093784.html)
```bash
/etc/hosts # is the static table lookup for host name
# which contains the host names and corresponding IP addresses
# web applications will access file like this for hostname-IP mapping
# DNS cache > hosts > DNS service
```
> *Reference:* [linux环境下/etc/hosts文件详解](https://www.jianshu.com/p/476a92a39b45)
```bash
/etc/fstab # is the file system table configuring partition mounting on startup
# <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
proc             /proc         proc        defaults              0       0
/dev/hda1        /             ext3        errors=remount-ro     0       1
/swapfile        /swap         swap        defaults              0       0
/dev/hdc         /media/cdrom0 udf,iso9660 user,noauto           0       0
```

- #### Use of curl and wget
```bash
# Common use for downloading
curl -O http://man.linuxde.net/text.iso # -O should be uppercase
wget http://www.linuxde.net/text.iso # no argument required
```
```bash
# Download and rename
curl -o rename.iso http://man.linuxde.net/text.iso # -o should be lowercase
wget -O rename.zip http://www.linuxde.net/text.iso # -O should be uppercase
```

- #### Other useful commands
```bash
fdisk -l                       # lists all mountable disks
df -l                          # lists all mouted disks
top                            # dynamically shows real-time system status
ps -ef | grep python           # lists all python processes with full format
kill -9 processId              # kills a process with its ID
ifconfig                       # checks the IP address
netstat                        # checks port status
free                           # shows memory usage
```
