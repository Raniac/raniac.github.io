# Ubuntu Tips and Tricks

- #### Count of files and directories
```bash
ls -l | grep "^-" | wc -l # count of regular files in current directory
ls -lR | grep "^-" | wc -l # count of regular files in current dir including those in sub-folders
```
```bash
ls -l | grep "^d" | wc -l # count of directories in current directory
ls -lR | grep "^d" | wc -l # count of directories in current directory including those in sub-folders
```
```bash
# Explaination
ls -l # means outputing the information of the specified directory as a list
# -R means recursively, showing the files within directories
| # means using the output of the command before it as the input of the one behind it
grep # means Globally search a Regular Expression and Print
# and "^d" represents directories, "^-" files
wc -l # means counting the number of lines of the output
# which in this case equals to the number of files/directories
```

- #### View files: cat, more and less
Basically *cat* can print the whole file in the terminal, which is convenient when file size is relatively small. But when file size is large and pagination is needed, *more* and *less* are both competent. A very useful argument that shows the line number is *-n* (for *cat*) and *-N* (for *less*).
> cat是一次性显示整个文件的内容，还可以将多个文件连接起来显示，它常与重定向符号配合使用，适用于文件内容少的情况；more和less一般用于显示文件内容超过一屏的内容，并且提供翻页的功能。more比cat强大，提供分页显示的功能，less比more更强大，提供翻页，跳转，查找等命令；而且more和less都支持：用空格显示下一页，按键b显示上一页。下面详细介绍这3个命令。

- #### Use of curl and wget
```bash
# Common use for downloading
curl -O http://man.linuxde.net/text.iso # -O should be uppercase
wget http://www.linuxde.net/text.iso # no argument required
```
```bash
# Download and rename
curl -o rename.iso http://man.linuxde.net/text.iso # -o should be lowercase
wget -O rename.zip http://www.linuxde.net/text.iso # -O should be uppercase
```
